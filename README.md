# Traffic Sign Recognition Using Negative Learning

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook titled "Projekat - procesuiranje slika.ipynb". The main goal of this project is to explore the potential of negative learning in improving the results of traffic sign recognition using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## Introduction

Negative learning is an interesting approach where we train the model using both correct and incorrect examples. This project delves into its application in the domain of traffic sign recognition.
